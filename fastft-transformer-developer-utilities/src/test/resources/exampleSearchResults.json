"content": "<p>Golfers are plagued by the fickleness of their swings - shining one round, unravelling the next. Retailers who make money out of selling clubs must wish their problems were as trivial.</p>\n\n<p>The chief executive of <a href=\"http://markets.ft.com/research/Markets/Tearsheets/Summary?s=DKS:NYQ\">Dick's Sporting Goods,</a> one of the biggest retailers of golf gear in America, on Tuesday declared that the retail market for golf is in \"structural decline.\"</p>\n\n<p>Edward Stack told Wall Street analysts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I think golf from a participation standpoint and how it translates into retail is in a structural decline. We don't see that changing. We don't know when it will flatten out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Dick's <a href=\"http://on.ft.com/YtzAKA\">took a $20m charge</a> in its second-quarter results, as it wrote down the value of clubs and other golf equipment and eliminated specialist sales roles in its golf division.</p>\n\n<p>The company said that eliminating golf specialists wouldn't put the retailer at a competitive disadvantage because demand is so weak.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Stack, whose father founded the chain shortly after the end of World War Two, lamented: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We just think that, as much as we all love golf, the business reality is that golf from a business viewpoint is under pressure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The slump in US golf demand isn't just squeezing Dick's. Last month, <a href=\"http://markets.ft.com/research/Markets/Tearsheets/Summary?s=ADSX.N:GER\">Adidas</a> said it would restructure its golf business, TaylorMade, because of sliding demand in the US. </p>",

Initial public offering revenues of $4.8bn is the third year-to-date total on record, only beaten by 2000 and 2007.</p>\n\n<p>But M&amp;A is playing its part, as the renewed animal spirits among corporate executive boost advisory fees to $12bn so far this year – following two consecutive year-to-date decreases, Dealogic notes.</p>\n\n<p>JPMorgan is the investment banking winner so far this year, taking down 8.3 per cent of the overall revenues. The US banking behemoth is followed by Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which account for 6.7 per cent and 6.5 per cent respectively.</p>",

"content": "<p>Carillion has sweetened its merger proposal for Balfour Beatty, as it renews its push to seal what would be a transformative deal for the UK construction industry. </p>\n\n<p>Carillion said the new offer would give Balfour Beatty shareholders a 58.3 per cent share in a combined company, up from a previously agreed 56.5 per cent. Balfour's investors would also get a cash dividend of 8.5 pence per share, valuing the company at nearly £2.1bn under the revised offer terms. </p>\n\n<p>Carillion's dogged pursuit of a tie-up with Balfour, which would create a construction giant with 80,000 employees, has become embroiled in a war of words in recent days, with Balfour management insisting it has a viable strategy to remain as a standalone company. </p>\n\n<p>Talks between the companies unexpectedly stalled earlier this month after Balfour went public with Carillion's opposition to its already planned sale of US design consultancy Parsons Brinckerhof. </p>\n\n<p>Here's the bullets from Carillion's statemen on Tuesday:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>58.268% share for Balfour Beatty shareholders based on the current undiluted ordinary share capital of each of Balfour Beatty and Carillion, as well as a cash dividend (or equivalent) of 8.5 pence per Balfour Beatty share (£59 million in total).

The bank also announced that Dean Athanasia, head of small business banking and Thong Nguyen, head of retail banking will now report directly to Mr Moynihan as members of the management team.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Moynihan's changes come as the bank nears a more than $16bn settlement with the Department of Justice on mortgage-backed securities. As the deal gets done, investors are shifting their focus to how the bank will start driving growth.</p>",
