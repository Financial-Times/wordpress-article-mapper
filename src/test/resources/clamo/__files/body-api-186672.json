		"content":"The question of why corporate America isn't investing much has become one of the most vexed as everyone scours for a potential catalyst to unlock faster economic growth.<!--more-->\n\nIt's why the monthly report from the Commerce Department on durable goods, which are taken as a proxy for business spending, garners some attention from investors.\n\nThe [latest figures](http:\/\/www.census.gov\/manufacturing\/m3\/adv\/pdf\/durgd.pdf) for June show durable goods climbed 0.7 per cent to $239.9bn, up from a 1 per cent decline in May and better than the 0.5 per cent rise forecast.\n\nOf more interest, a measure of orders excluding aircraft and defence orders rose 1.4 per cent, snapping two months of declines. Economists had predicted a 1.3 per cent jump.\n\nCompanies' orders for machinery drove the overall rise. Machinery orders climbed 2.4 per cent to $37.7bn. \n\nJune's overall increase is at least further confirmation that the economy rebounded last quarter from its contraction at the start of the year. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n",
