And we would have far more confidence on the 5-year progress of another online classified business, with a strong market position.<br />\nThough Business Insider has big traffic, it is difficult to build confidence that it will be an important site in 5 years’ time. Of course it may well grow as suggested, but there have to be risks from competition and “consumer taste” in that timeframe.<br />\nOverall, we think that Axel management would need to have a very good success with Business Insider in order to fully convince investors that this new direction is a good idea.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:09\">BE</span></p>\n<div class=\"messagebody\">\n<p>And here&#8217;s Deutsche.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:09\">BE</span></p>\n<div class=\"messagebody\">\n<blockquote><p>To start with the positives: AS management is clearly putting their money where their mouth is, expanding aggressively into digital content (to counter-balance the structural demise of its print business). Moreover, the total acquisition price is below what had been mooted in the press (c. USD 560m) and in line with implied valuations for other digital media assets (e.g. Vice Media, Buzzfeed). We concede that Business Insider has a strong growth trajectory backed by a distribution model geared towards mobile and social and with a focus on structurally growing ad formats such as video and native. Moreover, 30% of ad revenues (c. 85% of total sales) are sold via programmatic engines. We also agree that management has built a “proven” model as BI would have been break-even without investments in new verticals, i.e. “Tech Insider” and “Insider”.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:09\">BE</span></p>\n<div class=\"messagebody\">\n<blockquote><p>However, as expected, in the CC there was no mention of synergies between AS and BI, except for higher reach (combined, AS / BI are the 6th largest digital publisher globally by reach); in fact, Henry Blodget (CEO and Editor in Chief) mentioned that “BI does not like to be integrated”. Moreover, we note that BI management was not able to come up with a good answer as to “why sell now if growth prospects are that bright”. This naturally triggers the question whether such a deal will add value for AS shareholders, especially in light of underlying risks around the successful expansion into new verticals (where competition from other digital media is fierce) and new geographies outside the US (despite the launch in selected countries). Moreover, the sustainability of current trends in media consumption is not proven, and we note the rise of ad blockers in online advertising as a potential risk. Lastly, we flag that there was increasing criticism/allegations in the industry around Business Insiders’ practices of possible “traffic hijacking”, i.e. un-authorized use of (pieces of) third-party content to fuel reach.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:09\">BE</span></p>\n<div class=\"messagebody\">\n<blockquote><p>Based on management’s financial targets, i.e. 30% sales CAGR 2016-2020, EBITDA break-even in 2018 and long-term EBITDA margins of greater than 20%, the transaction price implies a multiple of 11-21x 2020E EBITDA, assuming a steep and, in our view, highly ambitious margin ramp beyond 2018 to 10-20% – clearly not undemanding for an asset with the characteristics outlined above.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:09\">BE</span></p>\n<div class=\"messagebody\">\n<p>It&#8217;s fair to say that the response to this one has been lukewarm.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:11\">BE</span></p>\n<div class=\"messagebody\">\n<p>Or, if you prefer, &#8220;These Analysts Think a German is Nuts And Here&#8217;s Why&#8221;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:11\">BE</span></p>\n<div class=\"messagebody\">\n<p>But let&#8217;s not head down that road.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\">\n<div class=\"messagebody\">11:11AM</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:12\">BE</span></p>\n<div class=\"messagebody\">\n<p>So.

At Glencore’s $16bn market cap, the shares imply a -$2bn equity<br />\nvalue for its Industrial assets, yet the realisable value of these assets alone<br />\nshould exceed their $29bn debt. GLEN has $13bn of available liquidity to<br />\nrefinance $6.4bn of bonds maturing by YE’16, and its bank debt has no<br />\nfinancial covenants. Despite its robust liquidity, we retain credit rating<br />\nconcerns; at current prices, we estimate a $10bn shortfall at YE’16 to preserve<br />\nits BBB. At today’s commodity prices, we believe GLEN is undervalued on<br />\nfundamentals, but asset sales and/or an additional capital raise will be required<br />\nto ease credit concerns. We thus remain Neutral with a £1.50/sh YE’16 PT</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:17\">BE</span></p>\n<div class=\"messagebody\">\n<blockquote><p> Liquidity concerns overstated in our view: Since announcing a $10bn<br />\ndebt-reduction plan on 7th Sept that included a $2.5bn equity raise, GLEN&#8217;s<br />\nCDS has risen to ~840bps and its share price has fallen 43%. We identify<br />\nlow refinancing risk in 2015/16; GLEN has ~$13bn of liquidity and debt is<br />\nprimarily long-dated bonds. GLEN’s $15bn revolving loan that supports its<br />\nMarketing activities has no financial covenants and carries no refinancing<br />\nrisk until May’18, meaning concerns that GLEN may be forced to liquidate<br />\n$18bn of trading inventory are exaggerated, in our view.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:18\">BE</span></p>\n<div class=\"messagebody\">\n<blockquote><p> Credit risk concerns are legitimate, but manageable: Preservation of a<br />\ncredit rating greater than BBB- is fundamental to its business model, in our view. At<br />\ncurrent prices, we estimate a $10bn shortfall at YE’16 to sustain the existing<br />\nBBB/Baa2, which rises to ~$15bn if commodity prices fall 5%. S&amp;P and<br />\nMoody’s have stated asset disposals are expected to reduce group debt and<br />\nwe expect will allow until H1&#8217;16 for remedies to be applied. We identify<br />\nupside to GLEN’s $2.0bn disposal target; we expect greater than $1bn from gold and<br />\nsilver pre-payments, plus $750-800m of EBITDA on spot in Agriculture<br />\ncould be worth ~$10bn if valued in line with recent transaction comps in<br />\nsoft commodity trading.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:18\">BE</span></p>\n<div class=\"messagebody\">\n<blockquote><p> Additional capital buffer required to eradicate credit concerns:<br />\nDownside risk will likely continue to dominate GLEN’s shares until it can<br />\nreinforce its capital base. Since disposals may not be complete until 2016,<br />\nfurther capital raise may be required to eliminate credit risks, in our view.<br />\n Valuation support is emerging: At its $16bn mkt cap, we calculate<br />\nGLEN’s Industrial assets are valued at just 6.0x EV/EBITDA versus 7.2x<br />\naverage for RIO, BHP and AAL ($4.5bn Industrial 2016E EBITDA on<br />\nspot). We believe the realisable value of GLEN’s entire Industrial assets<br />\nexceeds its ~$29bn debt; therefore a -$2.3bn implied market equity value for<br />\nthese assets is too pessimistic. We retain our Neutral rating and £1.50/sh PT.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:19\">BE</span></p>\n<div class=\"messagebody\">\n<p>And Macquarie, saying the same.

Since then, metal prices have moved progressively<br />\nlower without an offsetting move in producer currencies. At current spot<br />\nprices, GLEN would generate just $7.5bn in EBITDA ($9.9bn under base) and<br />\nFFO would fall to $6.1bn, forcing the credit metrics to the margin of the BBB<br />\nband, leaving the credit rating at risk of a downgrade. Under these conditions,<br />\nwe estimate that at least ~ $4bn of additional debt reduction initiatives would<br />\nneed to be announced to reassure the ratings agencies and the market that<br />\nGLEN is committed to defending its BBB rating. We believe there is scope to<br />\nmake up this shortfall, however, should spot prices fall by 5%, the debt<br />\nreduction target would need to rise by an additional $5.0bn ($19bn in total).</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:20\">BE</span></p>\n<div class=\"messagebody\">\n<blockquote><p>Fears of credit lines being withdrawn are overblown. The blow-out in<br />\nGLEN’s CDS spreads appear to be fuelling fears that credit lines could start<br />\nbeing withdrawn from the trading business. However, GLEN’s trading<br />\nbusiness is funded predominantly by syndicated revolving credit facilities<br />\namounting to $15.3bn, which the company refinanced in June 2015. Only<br />\n$6.5bn of this had been drawn by mid-year and we are not aware of any<br />\ntechnical triggers – related to credit rating or debt covenants – which could<br />\nlead to funding being withdrawn. Moreover, the lending banks have very little<br />\nnaked exposure as the company posts 100% collateral for every trade</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:20\">BE</span></p>\n<div class=\"messagebody\">\n<blockquote><p>Stock implying another ~8% leg down in commodity prices. Reducing the<br />\nspot commodity price deck by 8% and applying peer group multiples to Mining<br />\nand Trading EBITDA yields an equity value close to £0.70/sh. In contrast, our<br />\nbase case price deck suggests an equity value closer to £1.80/sh. Where the<br />\nstock ultimately ends up trading will therefore largely depend on the market’s<br />\nconfidence that GLEN will defend its BBB rating but also on sentiment<br />\ntowards commodity prices.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:20\">BE</span></p>\n<div class=\"messagebody\">\n<p>(@fjp73: was that a rhetorical question?

First, the interest rate<br />\nmarket is 250x bigger than the commodities market. Second, its<br />\nexposures seem manageable for US banks. Third, US banks are better<br />\nequipped to withstand disturbances. Versus 1997 (Long-Term Capital),<br />\nbanks have 5x more cash and 4x more capital. This scenario seems well<br />\nless than the Fed&#8217;s annual stress test. In sum, large bank estimates<br />\nremain at risk going into 3Q15 and secondary effects are tough to predict.<br />\nYet, events such as this have the potential to further show the resiliency<br />\nof the industry per our theme &#8220;Utility banking&#8221; &#8211; ie, regulation hurts<br />\ngrowth but helps in times such as this.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:22\">BE</span></p>\n<div class=\"messagebody\">\n<blockquote><p>Direct bank exposure<br />\nBanks do not disclose exposures to Glencore but we do not expect outsized<br />\nexposures when banks likely report on this in a couple weeks during<br />\nearnings. The most likely US bank exposure relates to $15bn of credit lines<br />\nwith banks ($6.6bn drawn as of mid-year), though this is likely spread among<br />\nover 20 banks, both domestic and foreign. Further, energy portfolios have<br />\nbeen heavily scrutinized by regulators and banks, making a large, undisclosed<br />\noutsized exposure to this sector extremely unlikely &#8211; ie, there are benefits<br />\nfrom extra regulation. The difference with Glencore&#8217;s total debt of $50bn also<br />\nrelates to $31bn of capital-market notes that would likely be held by a range<br />\nof capital-market participants and investors, though this would be part of any<br />\nexposure analysis at US banks.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:22\">BE</span></p>\n<div class=\"messagebody\">\n<blockquote><p>The industry is more resilient<br />\nOur theme with Utility Banking is that growth is slower than in the past but<br />\nthat the industry can absorb more unforeseen events, such as Glencore. This<br />\nmay or may not be one more of these tests, but the industry can absorb a<br />\nbody blow. Versus the period of Long-Term Capital (1997), the industry has<br />\n5x more cash ($1.8tn) and 4x more capital ($1.7tn). After size-adjusting the<br />\nindustry&#8217;s balance sheet, the industry has $700bn more cash and $400bn<br />\nmore equity versus this past period. In addition, the Fed&#8217;s stress test<br />\nassumes 10% unemployment, -6% GDP (one quarter), and the Dow at 8,700<br />\nbefore it allows banks to pay dividends or buy back stock.
