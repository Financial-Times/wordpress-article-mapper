Gross domestic product in the world’s second-largest economy expanded 7.3 per cent in the third quarter from the same period a year earlier, its weakest performance since the first quarter of 2009, when growth was just 6.6 per cent, but slightly above expectations. However, industrial production in China grew 8 per cent in September year-on-year, bouncing off the 6.9 per cent level it reached in August, which was its lowest since 2008.

The BoE said part of its real-time gross settlement system (RTGS), which underpins large transfers between bank accounts, had been “paused”, after routine maintenance. The breakdown meant the Chaps payment system, which last year processed £277bn of transactions a day, was down for more than nine hours. The bank was forced to start processing the most important payments manually.
