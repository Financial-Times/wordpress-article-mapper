<p>Two sets of charts from BCA Research with unclear implications:</p>
<p><a href="http://uat.ftalphaville.ft.com/files/2014/10/Chart5.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2012992" src="http://uat.ftalphaville.ft.com/files/2014/10/Chart5-e1413767777269.png" alt="" width="300" height="660" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://uat.ftalphaville.ft.com/files/2014/10/Chart9.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2013002" src="http://uat.ftalphaville.ft.com/files/2014/10/Chart9.png" alt="" width="328" height="443" /></a>One interpretation of these charts is that they explain the ostensibly casual reluctance of German policymakers to embrace aggressive demand-stimulating policies for Europe &#8212; whether that means dropping their <a href="http://uat.blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/2014/10/10/its-draghi-versus-weidmann-on-ecb-qe/" target="_blank">opposition</a> to Mario Draghi&#8217;s pursuit of a sufficiently big QE program, or lowering their <a title="Merkel defends fiscal rules as Paris and Rome put growth first - FT" href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/fedbfcfc-5518-11e4-b616-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=intl" target="_blank">resistance</a> to more budget flexibility for the French and Italian governments.</p>
<p>If the German public, whatever the latest <a title="Government Holds Firm in Germany in Face of Weakening Economy" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/business/international/government-holds-firm-in-germany-in-face-of-weakening-economy.html?_r=0" target="_blank">dour indicators</a>, feels good both about the domestic economy and about the country&#8217;s influence on Europe, what motivation is there for German policymakers to risk their reputations as thrifty guardians of public finances and purchasing power?</p>
<p>But the researchers at BCA have a different, more hopeful interpretation. A consensus is forming throughout Europe, they write, in which structural reforms are accepted as a required tradeoff for policies that spur growth:</p>
<blockquote><p>Will the German public and policymakers accept the <em>quid pro quo</em> of reforms for spending?</p>
<p>German politicians will publically maintain their hardline rhetoric on fiscal consolidation, but the German public clearly believes that things are going well at home (Chart 5) and Berlin is in the driver’s seat when it comes to pursuing German interests at the EU level (Chart 9). In other words, Berlin has plenty of spare political capital that will allow it to give ground to the rest of Europe, especially as Merkel’s CDU shares the governing coalition with the center-left Social Democratic Party and not with the mildly euroskeptic FDP anymore.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to understand that Germany is not in charge of Europe. Many of our clients and colleagues often speak of German power as if the Wehrmacht has returned to the streets of Paris and Rome. The reality is that Germany is only 27% of euro area GDP and it depends on the periphery plus France for 18% of its exports, or 8% of GDP. It would ultimately be suicidal for Germany to allow the periphery to descend into a full out deflationary spiral due to austerity.</p></blockquote>
<p>A consensus belief in reforms-for-stimulus is what Mario Draghi advocated in his remarkable <a href="http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2014/html/sp140822.en.html" target="_blank">speech</a> at Jackson Hole. Meanwhile the German disinclination to support stimulative policies increasingly runs against the prevailing sentiment, whose voices have <a title="The Economist" href="http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21625790-economic-woes-home-are-testing-angela-merkels-understanding-how-best-use-her" target="_blank">spiked</a> in number and volume.</p>
<p>Are the strategists right to believe that German policymakers are likely to yield, eventually? We don&#8217;t know and remain sceptical, especially given the unreadable <a title="Sedating, not leading - The Economist" href="http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21625790-economic-woes-home-are-testing-angela-merkels-understanding-how-best-use-her" target="_blank">idiosyncrasies</a> of German politics, but here&#8217;s hoping.</p>
