  "body": "<body><p>Telecom Italia has returned to growth in the third quarter after posting a 1.4 per cent rise in revenue to €4.8bn and an 8.5 per cent increase in earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation.</p>\n<p>The revenue performance followed a 12 per cent drop in the first quarter of the year followed by a near 8 per cent decline in the second. The rebound was driven by its business unit, which achieved its best quarterly results since 2007, and its Brazilian operations, <strong>writes Nic Fildes.</strong></p>\n<p>Giuseppe Recchi, executive chairman of Telecom Italia, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The turnaround is proceeding quickly, with results ahead of expectations.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The company kept its guidance for low single digit organic Ebitda growth in its home market steady.</p>\n<p>Exane BNP analysts said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Group revenues and group EBITDA are respectively 1.9% and 2.6% above consensus expectations.The company says it remains on track to deliver its EUR1.6bn cost cutting plan by 2018.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Shares dropped 2 per cent following the results with the stock down 36 per cent from the start of the year.</p>\n</body>",
